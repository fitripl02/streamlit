            Restaurant business is booming in Indonesia and in other countries. It seems that COVID-19 does not really shut down this business although the number of visitors decreased when lockdown is put in effect. This decrease in the number of visiting customers is a problem but there are restaurants that worked around this problem by using grab and gojek to deliver their food to the customers in their homes. According to a research by Arlindo Madeira et al. although restaurant owners were pessimistic that their restaurant will return to what it was before the pandemic, they have tough up strategies to run their business after the COVID-19 passes over. This means that the restaurant business is here to stay, with some changes.
